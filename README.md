## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ Studying at Warsaw University of Technology
- ðŸ’» Majoring in Data Science
- ðŸ“« Email: mzajaczkowski107@gmail.com

## Areas of intrest
I'm currently focused on building a solid foundation and gaining hands-on experience in the following areas:
- Quantitative Research
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Data-Driven Problem Solving


## Hackathon Projects  

I've been involved in several hackathons over time, each one helping me grow my skills and learn something new. Here are a few events Iâ€™ve participated in:

- [**HackYeah 2024**](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/PoopPatrol "Visit the repository") â€“ **2nd place** in the Activity and Wellness category 
- **EnsembleAI** â€“ **4th place**
  - [**Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**]("https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/EnsembleAI-Robustness/tree/main") - ResNet-based classifier trained to remain accurate on both clean and adversarially perturbed data using FGSM and PGD, optimizing the trade-off between robustness and standard accuracy.
  - [**Membership Inference Attack**](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/PoopPatrol "Visit the repository") - Implemented a membership inference attack on a ResNet18 model, using shadow models and statistical techniques to assign confidence scores and maximize AUC ROC under limited data access.
  - [**Model Stealing**](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/PoopPatrol "Visit the repository") Query-efficient model stealing pipeline to replicate a protected SSL encoder by minimizing the L2 distance between our surrogate modelâ€™s embeddings and the targetâ€™s outputs.

## University projects
  - [Bank Marketing Classification Model](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/MachineLearning-project1) A supervised machine learning project focused on predicting the outcome of bank marketing campaigns based on client data using advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.
  - [Soccer matches data analysis](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/Soccer-matches-data-analysis) Clustering football players based on in-game performance statistics using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
  - [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/Bioinformatics_Project) Recently discovered algorithms and developed computers give scientists chance to create more and more advanced models of chromatin that are very similar to the reality. This paper presents the result of the work on modelling chromatin using popular tools.
  - [Messenger data visualisation dashboard](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/projectMe) developed in R (Shiny). The aim was to prepare interactive dashboard which presents data analysis about authors. We chose data from messaging app - Messenger and visualized them.
  - [E-commerce store](https://github.com/Zajaczkowskim/Django_Project) web application developed with Django, allowing users to browse, filter and purchase products.
